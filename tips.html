        <h2>4 Effective Study Techiniques you should try</h2>
        <p>Have you ever feel that you spent a lot of time sit on your
            table but you can't get your study done. Or reading the textbook
            over and over again but still feel like you can't remember anything.
            That's because you haven't try the right study technique. As a student
            who also stuggle with my study, I have found some study techniques that
            make my study more effective </p>

        <h3>1. Pomodoro</h3>
        <img class="tipPics" src="./photos/promodoro.jpeg" alt="pomodro image">

        <p>Instead of finish everything at one time without break, try to break your
            study into smaller section. Pomodoro Techinique is a time management system
            that break your workday into 25 minutes work and 5 minutes break. After 4 sections,
            you can have a longer break for 15-30 minutes. This method will help you reduce the stress
            level of your work, giving you a small break between each section can help you reset your
            brain and bring your attention back.
